# `apparebit-com`

While nominally a package amongst others in js-junction, this package contains
the source code and other assets for generating version 3.0 of
<http://apparebit.com> with Proact and, once released, using https. As such,
there is little benefit to actually publishing the package. Besides, it is
necessarily incomplete, since the website utilizes commercially licensed fonts.
