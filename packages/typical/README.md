# @grr/typical

> Light-weight type combinators for data validation and modelling.

This package is as much an adverse reaction to overly complex yet strangely
permissive validation libraries ‚Äî such as [ajv](https://ajv.js.org) and
[joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) ‚Äî as it is sincere flattery for Giulio
Canti's [tcomb](https://github.com/gcanti/tcomb). __@grr/typical__ blatantly
imitates __tcomb__'s overall design and provides currently six combinators that
build executable type specifications from simpler ones. A seventh combinator
provides the base types, with each delegating to a JavaScript function that
determines whether a value of a given type.

Beyond that, the two packages differ quite a bit. Most importantly,
__@grr/typical__ seeks to be a self-contained solution for data validation and
modelling but no more. Hence it makes different trade-offs in what does and does
not warrant inclusion in the package. For example, __tcomb__ separates
validation into the
[tcomb-validation](https://github.com/gcanti/tcomb-validation) package, leading
to some code duplication because both __tcomb__ and __tcomb-validation__ include
code for traversing types. __@grr/typical__ uses the exact same code for both ‚Äî
modulo four simple conditionals out of 700 lines of JavaScript in
[Prettier](https://prettier.io) format. At the same time, this package does not
support __tcomb__'s `func()` and `interface()` combinators nor the `match()` and
`update()` functions. In fact, it probably will never support them, since none
seems strictly necessary for validating and instantiating plain data, as is
necessary when processing, say, configuration state or application-level
messages.


## API

Add __@grr/typical__ to your project.

```bash
yarn add @grr/typical
```

Once the package is installed, you can import __@grr/typical__'s API.

```js
import typical from '@grr/typical';
```

When I say API, I really mean a JavaScript object with configuration options,
some constants, the type combinators as methods, and predefined _typical_ types
covering the most basic use cases.

You should always invoke type combinators by calling them as methods of an API
object, not as functions. However, you may create new API objects, e.g., to
create _typical_ types with a different configuration, simply by making a
shallow copy of an existing API object.

```js
const typ = Object.assign({}, typical, { continueAfterError: true });
const MyString = typ.base('MyString', v => typeof v === 'String');

MyString('hello'); // üëç 'hello'
MyString(665);     // üí• TypeError: due to 1 type violation:
                   //      #1: value "665" is not of type MyString
                   //      at Context.throwError ...
```

The example first creates a new API object, with the `continueAfterError` option
enabled. Then it invokes the `base()` combinator to create our first _typical_
type named `MyString`. It conveniently corresponds to JavaScript strings.
Finally, we validate two different values as my strings, with the first one
succeeding and returning the value and the second one failing and throwing an
error.

Conveniently, you don't need to define a string type in your own projects, since
the built-in `typical.String` corresponds to JavaScript strings. Its definition
is pretty much the same as for my string.


### 1. Configuration

To accommodate better accommodate different use cases, __@grr/typical__ supports
a few configuration options. You configure them either by setting the namesake
property on an API object or by passing an object with those properties to a
_typical_ type as the second argument, right after the value:

```js
MyString('hello', { continueAfterError: false });
```

In this case, we are disabling the `continueAfterError` option again, but that
only lasts for the duration of the call. All options default to not being set
and, more importantly, not even be specified, i.e., `undefined`, and thus
ignored. __@grr/typical__ uses this simple technique to help maximize
flexibility in configuration management without resulting in undue complexity.
Concretely, this package combines options specified in different

  but in code default to `void 0`.
That is intended to help produce predictable behavior since __@grr/typical__
combines option values specified at different times and must do so in some
order. To maximize expressivity and remain easily predictable, this package
employs two simple rules:

 1. Given an object with configuration options, ignore all properties that are
    either missing or have `undefined` as value.


Supported options are:

  + `continueAfterError` determines whether the recursive traversal of type and
    value continues after encountering an error. The default is to terminate
    the traversal after the first error.
  + `ignoreExtraProps` determines whether records, which are simply JavaScript
    objects, may have additional properties beyond those specified for the
    record type. The default is not to allow extra properties.
  + `validateAndCopy` determines whether to recursively copy the values of
    compound types, i.e., arrays, tuples, and records. The default is to
    validate values only.
  + `recognizeAsArray` determines what values are recognized as valid array
    values. There are three options, described next under Constants.

If both `ignoreExtraProps` and `validateAndCopy` are enabled, then the copy
returned from a _typical_ record type does _not_ include extra properties, even
if they are present in the object passed into the function representing a
record type.


### 2. Useful Constants

Typical's API object includes three constants to be used with the
`recognizeAsArray` option.

  + `ARRAY_ONLY` indicates to only accept an array value as an array type. This
    is the default.
  + `ELEMENT_OR_ARRAY` indicates to also accept a value that matches the array
    type's element type. In that case, the value is automatically coerced to a
    well-formed array by creating a new array with the value as its only element.
  + `NONE_ELEMENT_OR_ARRAY` indicates to also accept `undefined` or `null` as an
    array. In that case, the value is automatically coerced to a well-formed
    array by creating a new empty array.

This description of type checks is _not_ exhaustive. Notably, to match an array
type, every element of a non-empty array value must also match the array type's
element type.


### 3. Built-In Types

Conveniently, this package pre-defines a number of generally useful _typical_
types. Their names are nouns by this package's convention (not imperative verbs)
and, where possible, are the same as those of corresponding TypeScript types,
with the first letter capitalized.

  + `typical.Any` is the type representing the universe of all possible values,
    i.e., _top_.
  + `typical.Void` is the opposite type, representing only the `undefined` and
    `null` values, i.e., _bottom_.
  + `typical.Boolean`, `typical.Number`, `typical.String`, and `typical.Symbol`
    are _typical_ types that are equivalent to the namesake primitive types in
    JavaScript (but not the boxed versions).
  + `typical.Integer` is a refinement of `typical.Number` and represents all
    safe integers, as determined by JavaScript's `Number.isSafeInteger()`.
  + `typical.URL` is a refinement of `typical.String` and represents all [WHATWG
    URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org) values, whether they are relative or
    absolute.

### 4. Type-Creating Combinators

__@grr/typical__'s combinators create new _typical_ types, with each type being
a function that validates and possibly copies a values. Additionally, every
_typical_ type has an `is()` property that implements a predicate on values
returning `true` for a match and `false` otherwise. The `meta` property includes
several properties that describe how a type was constructed.

  + `type.meta.name` specifies the _typical_ type's name.
  + `type.meta.kind` specifies the lower-case combinator name.
  + `type.meta.base` specifies the lone type argument for refinements, options,
    enumerations, and arrays.
  + `type.meta.components` specifies the components for enumerations, tuples,
    and records.

#### `typical.base(name, predicate)`

Define a new base type, which matches a value if the predicate returns a
non-falsy value. Base types are the only possible leafs in the combinator tree
of a _typical_ type. They also are expressed in terms of restrictions on host
language values. In other words, this ensures that every _typical_ type
ultimately is grounded in JavaScript, just like this definition of a number
type:

```js
const MyNumber = typical.base('MyNumber', v => typeof v === 'Number');
assert(MyNumber.is(42)); // üëç
```

#### `typical.refinement(type, name, predicate)`

Define a new refinement type, which matches a value if the value matches the
base type and futher matches the refinement's predicate. For example, the
following code snippet derives an integer type from the above number type:

```js
const MyInteger = typical.refinement('MyInteger', Number.isSafeInteger);
assert(MyInteger.is(42)); // üëç
```

#### `typical.option(type, name = type.name + 'Option')`

Define a new option type, which matches a value if the value is `undefined` or
`null`, or if the value matches the base type. Using the `MyString` type from
way above, we can now make the text value optional:

```js
const MyOptionalString = typical.option(MyString);
assert(MyOptionalString.is(null)); // üëç
assert(MyOptionalString.is('hello')); // üëç
```

#### `typical.enum(type, name, ...constants)`

Define a new enumeration type, which matches a value if, recursively, the value
is the same as one of the constants. For the enumeration to be valid, every
constant must match the base type. The implementation of enumeration types uses
`Object.is()` for equality testing. That works well for enumeration constants
that are JavaScript numbers and strings (`typical.Number` and `typical.String`)
but does not work well for objects and arrays. After all, `Object.is()` only
detects identity for the latter two types. In scenarios where this is in fact
desired, JavaScript symbols (`typical.Symbol`) are the better alternative since
they are explicitly designed for this use case.

When compared to the `===` operator, `Object.is()` not only has cleaner
semantics but also turns `NaN` into a perfectly [valid enumeration
constant](https://github.com/apparebit/js-junction/tests/typical.spec.js#L391).
In case that this does not impress you, I can only state that I never jest about
`NaN`. In fact, I am certain that, if one built a trading platform with IEEE
floating point double precision numbers as the primary numeric datatype, then
`NaN` would become a ubiquitous error sentinel. NaN FTW!

```js
const NotANumber = typical.enum(MyNumber, 'NotANumber', NaN);
assert(NotANumber.is(NaN)); // üëç
```

#### `typical.array(type, name = type.name + 'Array', { recognizeAsArray } = {})`

Define a new array type, which matches JavaScript array values if, recursively,
all array elements match the array type's element type.

As already detailed above, the `recognizeAsArray` option can take on one of
three values:

  + `typical.ARRAY_ONLY` is the default and results in the behavior just
    described, i.e., array value elements being matched against the array type's
    element type.
  + `typical.ELEMENT_OR_ARRAY` relaxes validation to also treat a single value
    that matches the array type's element type as a singleton array value.
  + `typical.NONE_ELEMENT_OR_ARRAY` relaxes validation even further and also
    accepts `undefined` and `null` for an empty array value.

For example, we can define an array using the last option as follows:

```js
const MyArray = typical.array(MyInteger, 'MyArray', {
  recognizedAsArray: typical.NONE_ELEMENT_OR_ARRAY
});

assert.deepStrictEqual(MyArray(null), []); // üëç
assert.deepStrictEqual(MyArray(665), [665]); // üëç
assert.deepStrictEqual(MyArray([665]), [665]); // üëç
assert.deepStrictEqual(MyArray([13, 42]), [13, 42]); // üëç
```

#### `typical.tuple(name, ...types)`

Define a new tuple type, which matches JavaScript arrays if, recursively, the
number and sequence of types matches the number and sequence of elements in the
array.

```js
const Twople = typical.tuple('Pair', MyString, MyInteger);
assert(Twople.is(['lucky', 42])); // üëç
```

#### `typical.record(components)` ‚Äî also: `record(name, components, { ignoreExtraProps } = {})`

Define a new record type, which matches JavaScript objects if, recursively, each
name-to-type mapping matches the name-to-value mapping for the same name. The
typical record type is named after the first combinator argument, if that
argument is a string; otherwise, the name defaults to `'SomeRecord'`. Only the
enumerable own-properties of the components object are considered for record
fields.

As already described above, the `ignoreExtraProps` controls whether an object
may have only properties explicitly defined as components or extra, arbitrary
properties, which are ignored. In the latter case, the extra properties are not
copied into the freshly created record object. If `typical.record()` returns
some type function `MyRecord()`, the prototype of newly created records returned
from `MyRecord()` is the same value as `MyRecord.prototype`:

```js
const MyURL = ...; // Ooh, an exercise for the reader! üòé

const Person = typical.record('Person', {
  name: MyString,
  url: typical.option(MyURL),
});

// Passing a true validateAndCopy option to Person() makes sure
// that reachable objects and arrays are recursively recreated.
const dt = { name: 'Robert Grimm', url: 'https://apparebit.com' }
const me = Person(dt, { validateAndCopy: true });

assert(Object.getPrototypeOf(me) === Person.prototype); // üëç
assert(me !== dt); // üëç
assert(me.name === me.name); // üëç
assert(me.url === me.url); // üëç
```


## 5. Introspection

To help debug failing typical operations, this package optionally logs every
single assertion, validation, and validating creation with the
[debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) log package. As usual, you enable
logging by adding the scope corresponding to this package's registry name to the
`DEBUG` environment variable:

```bash
DEBUG=@grr:typical yarn test
```

That should produce many lines looking like the following two:

```
@grr:typical FAIL validate value "665" with option type "StringOption" +1ms
@grr:typical PASS   assert value "13" with refinement type "Integer" +4ms
```

__@grr/typical__ creates one log entry for every call to a _typical_ type.
Recursive calls to _typical_ types made as part of that invocation are not
logged, since their result figures into the overall result anyway. This package
records, in order, the state of the match, the kind of the match, the value, and
the kind and name of the type.

The state of the match is either `PASS` or `FAIL`.

The kind of the match is one of three tokens:

  + `assert` when matching type and value through the _typical_ type's `is()`
    predicate.

    ```js
    Boolean.is(665); // üí•  @grr:typical FAIL assert value "665" ...
    ```

  + `validate` when the `validateAndCopy` option is `false`. In that case, the
    call to the _typical_ type is expect to produce detailed error information
    yet return any valid value. In case of a validation failure, the type throws
    an error, whose `causes` property is an array with either the first error
    encountered or all errors encountered depending on the `continueAfterError`
    option.

    ```js
    const o = { name: 'Robert Grimm', url: 'https://apparebit.com' };
    const p = Person(o); // üëç  @grr:typical PASS validate value "{ ... }"
    assert(o === p); // ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Person() just passes valid value through.
    ```

  + `create` when the `validateAndCopy` option is `true` and all JavaScript
    objects and arrays are copied into newly allocated containers.

    ```js
    const p = Person(o); // üëç  @grr:typical PASS create value "{ ... }"
    assert(o !== p); // ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Person() creates a new record with proper prototype.
    assert(Object.getPrototypeOf(p) === Person.prototype);
    ```

To copy properties between objects, this package let `Object.assign()` do the
heavy lifting. However, that also means that only enumerable own-properties can
be copied and only so if they do not include getters or setters.


## ECMAScript Only

This package contains only ECMAScript modules with the `.js` file extension. It
may not run natively on Node.js without a suitable [loader
hook](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v9.x/docs/api/esm.html#esm_loader_hooks).
It does, however, run with [esm](https://github.com/standard-things/esm), a
light-weight just-in-time transpiler for Node.js 6 or later.
