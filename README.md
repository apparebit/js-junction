# js-junction

Welcome to [Robert Grimm](http://apparebit.com)'s monorepo for all things
JavaScript. While Robert is known as [apparebit](https://github.com/apparebit)
on GitHub, he uses the onomatopoetic alias [grr](https://www.npmjs.com/~grr) on
npm. He also [keeps
notes](https://github.com/apparebit/js-junction/tree/master/notes.md) on his
experiences with Node.js.

## 1. Packages Start With @grr

Conveniently, the latter name also serves as namespace for this repository's
open source packages:

 *  [mark-of-dev](https://github.com/apparebit/js-junction/tree/master/packages/mark-of-dev):
    Advancing the globalization of `__DEV__` (even without the @grr).

 *  [@grr/typical](https://github.com/apparebit/js-junction/tree/master/packages/typical):
    Type combinators for data validation and modelling.

 *  [@grr/err](https://github.com/apparebit/js-junction/tree/master/packages/err):
    The joy of refined errors â€” with code, pun, and Oxford comma.

 *  [@grr/sequitur](https://github.com/apparebit/js-junction/tree/master/packages/sequitur):
    Fluent and lazy combinators for `next()` and `yield`.

 *  [@grr/oddjob](https://github.com/apparebit/js-junction/tree/master/packages/oddjob):
    Letting you focus on the flying circus.

 *  [@grr/inventory](https://github.com/apparebit/js-junction/tree/master/packages/inventory):
    Keeping track of modules, packages, and repositories.

 *  [@grr/knowledge](https://github.com/apparebit/js-junction/tree/master/packages/knowledge):
    Making the JSON-LD flavor of Schema.org palatable.

 *  [@grr/proact](https://github.com/apparebit/js-junction/tree/master/packages/proact):
    Making server-side rendering great again.

 *  [@grr/enact](https://github.com/apparebit/js-junction/tree/master/packages/enact):
    Making server-side rendering progressively scalable.

 *  [@grr/metaweb](https://github.com/apparebit/js-junction/tree/master/packages/metaweb):
    Practical website metadata based on Schema.org and encoded as plain JSON.

 *  [@grr/metawebpage](https://github.com/apparebit/js-junction/tree/master/packages/metawebpage):
    View components for rendering best practices `<html>` and `<head>`.

### ðŸ’¯Â Â Test Coverage Is MaximalÂ 

All packages in this repository have 100% test coverage across statements,
branches, functions, and lines alike. Anything less would be uncivilized â€” and a
tad reckless for a dynamically typed programming language!


### ðŸ†•Â Â Upgrades Are Deliberate

All packages in this repository follow [semantic
versioning](https://semver.org). It serves as a widely accepted convention for
encoding an _expectation_ about the impact of a package upgrade. However, it
only is a convention and cannot provide a _guarantee_ that an upgrade won't
break an application. Even with exacting adherence to the specification, it is
easy enough to make a mistake and allow an incompatible change to sneak into a
minor version update. Given that reality, this repository disallows the use of
version ranges, which may just lead to updates being applied at inopportune
times. Instead, it requires (periodic) human intervention to upgrade and,
critically, to test afterwards. The [version.js](/scripts/version.js) script
helps with inspecting and modifying versions.

## 2. Modules End With .js

This repository contains only ECMAScript modules with the `.js` file extension.
It may not run natively on Node.js without a suitable [loader
hook](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v9.x/docs/api/esm.html#esm_loader_hooks).
It does, however, run with [esm](https://github.com/standard-things/esm), a
light-weight just-in-time transpiler for Node.js 6 or later. For the most part,
__esm__ just works. However, reliably determining code coverage can be
[surprisingly
tricky](https://github.com/apparebit/js-junction/tree/master/notes.md).
