# js-junction

Welcome to [Robert Grimm](http://apparebit.com)'s monorepo for all things
JavaScript. While Robert may be known as [grimmr](https://github.com/grimmr) on
GitHub, he uses the onomatopoetic alias [grr](https://www.npmjs.com/~grr) on
npm. Conveniently, the latter also serves as namespace for his open source
packages:

 *  [@grr/oddjob](https://github.com/grimmr/js-junction/tree/master/packages/oddjob):
    letting you focus on the flying circus.

 *  [@grr/proact](https://github.com/grimmr/js-junction/tree/master/packages/proact):
    making server-side rendering great again.
