# js-junction

Welcome to [Robert Grimm](http://apparebit.com)'s monorepo for all things
JavaScript. While Robert may be known as
[apparebit](https://github.com/apparebit) on GitHub, he uses
[grr](https://www.npmjs.com/~grr) on npm. Conveniently, the latter also serves
as namespace for this repository's open source packages:

 *  [@grr/mark-of-dev](https://github.com/apparebit/js-junction/tree/master/packages/mark-of-dev):
    Advancing the globalization of `__DEV__`.

 *  [@grr/oddjob](https://github.com/apparebit/js-junction/tree/master/packages/oddjob):
    Letting you focus on the flying circus.

 *  [@grr/proact](https://github.com/apparebit/js-junction/tree/master/packages/proact):
    Making server-side rendering great again.

All packages have 100% test coverage across statements, branches, functions,
and lines alike. Anything less would be uncivilized — and a tad reckless for a
dynamically typed programming language!

## ECMAScript Only

This repository contains only ECMAScript modules with the `.js` file extension.
It may not run natively on Node.js without a suitable [loader
hook](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v9.x/docs/api/esm.html#esm_loader_hooks).
It does, however, run with [esm](https://github.com/standard-things/esm), a
light-weight just-in-time transpiler for Node.js 6 or later.
